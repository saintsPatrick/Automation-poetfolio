# # Automation Portfolio â€“ Saint Patrick

This portfolio highlights some of my recent automation work using Make.com, Zapier, and other integration platforms.

## 1. Lead Routing Automation (Notion CRM + Cal.com)
- **Goal:** Capture leads from Ads, Email/SMS, and Organic traffic.  
- **Setup:**  
  - Leads routed into Notion CRM.  
  - Automatically tagged based on source (Meta Ads, Email/SMS, Organic).  
  - Synced with Cal.com for booked calls.  
- **Result:** Improved clarity of lead sources and eliminated manual data entry.

## 2. Documentation & Workflow Cleanup
- Rebuilt undocumented Make.com workflows.  
- Created clear documentation for each automation.  
- Implemented a naming convention for easier management.  

## 3. CRM Pipeline Automations
- Integrated multiple pipelines (Main Sales CRM + Enterprise Sales CRM).  
- Auto-assigned leads into the correct CRM based on CTA (Book a Call / Start Trial).  
- Ensured data consistency across systems.
